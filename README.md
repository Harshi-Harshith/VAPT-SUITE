# VAPT-SUITE
This project is a compilation of different tools and techniques that are utilized to perform vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on the client and server machines of an organization, which can further assist the orgranization in risk assessment.
The techniques use different kali linux commands that are supposed to be executed on different systems, namely kali linux(attacker), metasploitable(victim server machine) and windows 10(victim client machine) in a definite order.
All the commands are mentioned in the document along with screenshots of execution and the codes for rev_HTTPS payload.
Attacks on Server Machine: Exploiting the misconfiguration of the "R" service port 512/TCP, Searching for an existing backdoor, Creating a new backdoor via code execution vulnerability.
Attacks on Client Machine: Internal attack, External attack via critical window update, Creating a fake windows update (Social Engineering Framework).
